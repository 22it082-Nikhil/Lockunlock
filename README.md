# lockunlock

A new Flutter project## Project Overview
Lock Unlock is a smart door lock control application built using Flutter framework that enables users to remotely manage and monitor their smart door locks. The app provides a secure and convenient way to control access to homes, offices, or any spaces equipped with compatible smart locks.

## Key Features
- Remote Lock/Unlock: Control smart locks from anywhere using internet connectivity
- Real-time Status: Monitor lock status (locked/unlocked) in real-time
- Access Management: Grant or revoke access permissions to family members, guests, or staff
- Access History: View detailed logs of lock/unlock events with timestamps and user info
- Multiple Lock Support: Manage multiple smart locks from a single app interface
- Biometric Security: Additional layer of security using fingerprint/face authentication
- Push Notifications: Instant alerts for lock status changes and unauthorized access attempts

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Built with Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS & Android)
- **Backend**: Firebase for real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for efficient app state handling
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for data transmission
- **Smart Lock Integration**: Compatible with major smart lock brands via their APIs
- **Local Storage**: Secure storage of user preferences and cached data

## System Requirements
- Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher
- iOS 11.0 or higher
- Bluetooth 4.0 LE support for local lock communication
- Internet connectivity for remote operations
- Compatible smart lock hardware

## Architecture
The app follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- Presentation Layer: Flutter UI components
